# Bike Fall Detection Project

**Description:** This project focuses on enhancing bicycle safety through innovative technology. The team is investigating the use of an airbag system triggered by an accelerometer to protect cyclists during severe falls. By utilizing this technology, they aim to address the growing number of cyclists and their increasing speeds, aligning with the theme of "health and prevention."

**Group Members:** 
- RANCOULE Gauthier
- MATHIS Wattecant

**Objective:** 
The primary objective of this project is to determine how accelerometers can reliably contribute to cyclist safety. The team aims to select activation thresholds that maximize cyclist protection while maintaining precision, and they will explore the accuracy, response time, and other aspects of the sensor.

**Key Features:**
- Investigating the use of accelerometers for bicycle safety
- Utilizing an airbag system triggered by accelerometers to protect cyclists
- Researching real-world applications and scenarios
- Exploring activation threshold settings for cyclist protection

**References:** The project draws from various sources and references, including studies on bicycle accident typologies and exposure risks, developments in bicycle commuting, and technical details of airbag systems for cyclists.
